Parsers
=======
Parsers are stored in ``/srv/flayer/parsers``. Each parser _must_ have a
function called ``func_map()`` which examines a URL and returns whether or not
that module can handle it, and if so, which function to run for it. This
function might look like:

.. code-block:: python

    def func_map(url):
        '''
        Function map
        '''
        if 'wikipedia' in url:
            return wikipedia_raw
        return None

This states that if a URL contains ``wikipedia``, then the ``wikipedia_raw``
function should be called. Make sure to pass the function object
(``wikipedia_raw``) and not the contents of the function
(``wikipedia_raw()``). An example of this function is provided below.

There may also optionally be a function called ``pre_flight``. This function is
meant to check the URL and perform any last-minute operations before parsing
the page. This is largely useful for processing a URL that should not be
cached, such as one that is expected to have dynamic data. This function might
look like:

.. code-block:: python

    def pre_flight(url_id, url):
        if 'mysite.com' in url and '/dynamic/' in url:
            url_id = 0
            content = ''
        return url_id, url, content

The above function would look at the URL and decide whether it looks like a
page is expected to be dynamic. If so, it sets the ``url_id`` to ``0`` and the
``content`` to an empty string. When Web Flayer later looks at the ``url_id``
and sees that it is already set to ``0``, it will skip caching the data.

This function must always accept ``url_id`` and ``url``.

Other public functions are expected to be used for processing URLs and their
contents. In order for these functions to be called, they must be mapped in
the ``func_map()`` function as described above.

These (and all non-dunder) functions have the following built-in variables
available to them:

* ``__opts__``: A reference to the Web Flayer configuration
* ``__urls__``: A reference to the in-memory URL queue (but not the database queue)
* ``__dbclient__``: A reference to the database client object

The following variables are required in the function declaration:

* ``url_id``: The ``url_id`` for the database record
* ``url``: The URL being processed
* ``content``: The content of the URL being processed

These functions do not return any data. They process the content and perform
whatever action is necessary (mining more URLs, downloading media files, saving
necessary data to a file or database, etc).

Consider the following function:

.. code-block:: python

    def wikipedia_raw(url_id, url, content):
        '''
        Grab raw wikipedia data
        '''
        cache_path = __opts__.get('wikipedia_cache_path', '.')
        title = url.split('?')[0].split('/')[-1]
        file_name = '{}/{}'.format(cache_path, title)
        req = requests.get(url, stream=True, params={'action': 'raw'})
        flayer.tools.status(req, url, file_name)

In this function, the following will happen:

* First, get the ``cache_path`` from the configuration file. If it isn't there, use the current working directory (``.``).
* Extract the ``title`` of the page from the URL.
* Generate the output file_name using the ``cache_path`` and the ``title``.
* Set up a ``requests`` object to download the raw version of the URL.
* Use ``flayer.tools.status`` to download the URL. This function is discussed below.

The above function only makes use of the ``url``, and only because it needs to
extract information from that URL. Because the ``content`` of that URL is also
passed in, you may only need your function to process that. The ``url_id`` is
provided in case you need to refer to the URL's location in Web Flayer's
database.

It is common for data mining tools to collect links while processing a page.
If a function finds more URLs that need to be processed, it may append them 
directly to the ``__urls__`` list, and they will be processed in turn. However,
it is better to add then directly to the database by calling ``queue_urls``
from the ``flayer.tools`` module:

.. code-block:: python

    import flayer.tools
    flayer.tools.queue_urls(new_urls, __dbclient__, __opts__)

The ``flayer.tools.status`` function is available for URLs that point to a file
that needs to be downloaded to disk. For example, this could be a chunk of
JSON, an image, or a larger file such as a tarball or a video. This function
will not only download that file, but also provide status on the download.

Once a filename has been generated to save the file to, there are two steps
that are performed:

* Set up a requests object to perform the download.
* Pass that object, along with the URL and filename, to the ``status`` function.

Consider the following block of code:

.. code-block:: python

    import requests
    import flayer.tools
    req = requests.get(url, stream=True)
    flayer.tools.status(req, url, file_name, opts=__opts__)

First, a ``requests`` object called ``req`` is set up, which ``stream`` set to
``True``. Please note that the ``status`` function requires this to be set.

Then that object, along with the url, the filename, and the ``opts``, is passed
to ``status``, which will perform the download, while generating updates, as
one might expect from a program like ``wget``.


Searchers
=========
Parsers are stored in ``/srv/flayer/searchers``. Each parser _must_ have a
function called ``search()`` which queries a search engine (or some other
platform that has search support) and returns the results.

To search, a user would use the ``--search`` flag:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ flayer --search myexample 'chocolate cake'

A basic ``search()`` function might look like:

.. code-block:: python

    def search():
        '''
        Search something
        '''
        query = __opts__['search'][1].replace(' ', '+')
        url = 'http://example.com?q={}'.format(query)
        req = requests.get(url)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(req.text, 'html.parser')
        urls = set()
        for tag in soup.find_all('a'):
            try:
                link = tag.attrs['href']
            except ValueError:
                continue
            urls.add(link)
        return list(urls)

All query data is stored in ``__opts__``. ``__opts__['search']`` contains at
least two values: the name of the search engine being used, and any query data
that is necessary. Normally only one value is used, but custom searchers can
make use of as many as they need, so long as they know how to handle them.

In this case, very basic URL encoding has been applied to the search data.
A request is made against that search engine, and the data is processed by
the BeautifulSoup library. In this example, all ``href`` s are returned.

The final list of links must always be returned as a ``list``.

Extra Search Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are some extra options that are available for working with searchers.

search_limit
````````````
It is expected that a search engine has a self-imposed limit of how many URLs
to return. If that limit is configurable, a new value can be passed from the
command line with the ``--search-limit`` option. This value will appear in
``__opts__`` as ``search_limit``. The example above might make use of the
following changes:

.. code-block:: python

        query = __opts__['search'][1].replace(' ', '+')
        limit = __opts__.get('search_limit', 50)
        url = 'http://example.com?q={}&num={}'.format(query, limit)
        req = requests.get(url)


search_organize
```````````````
Normally when a search is performed, the results will be returned to the user,
with no further action taken. However, with a data mining tool, there is a
good chance that further action is desired. The ``--search-organize`` option
provides a map between search results, and the parsers that handle them.

Organizers are explained in detail below.


Organizers
==========
Organizers are stored in ``/srv/flayer/organizers``. The point of an organizer
is to look at a URL and sort or organize it in some manner. Many times, their
task is simply to weed out URLs that don't contain desirable data, and then
add the others to the queue to be downloaded and processed by a parser.

For example, the ``jsonld_recipes`` organizer and parser work together, to
accomplish one job: find and process URLs that contain recipes stored in the
``application/ld+json`` format.

For more information on this format, see https://jsonld.com/.

Organizers _must_ have an organize function, which accepts a single argument
of ``url``. Take a look at the following example:

.. code-block:: python

    import requests
    import flayer.tools
    def organize(url):
        '''
        Organize a page depending on its content
        '''
        req = requests.get(url)
        if 'desired data' in req.text:
            flayer.tools.queue_urls(url, __dbclient__, __opts__)

An organizer doesn't need to be any more advanced than this. Note that
``requests`` is used directly instead of Web Flayer's own built-in tools, so
that the URL doesn't get cached. Parsers don't like to download URLs unless
``--force`` d to, so it's important not to cache them.
